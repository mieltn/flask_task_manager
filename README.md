# Test backend project
Task Master app allows:
- to add tasks to be done
- update existing tasks
- delete tasks

Task objects are stored in SQLite3 and backend interactions are handled by flask.
The project was created by following [this tutorial](https://github.com/jakerieger/FlaskIntroduction) at freecodecamp YT to get to know flask infrustructure.
